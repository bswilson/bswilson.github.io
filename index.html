    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <p>I'm a longtime cybersecurity professional, who currently manages multiple clients' Vulnerability and Exposure Management programs. I provide ongoing consulting for program improvement to executives, program leads, and other customer groups. I'm responsible for many day-to-day operations including customer management, program support, financial review and oversight, and internal process development and maturity efforts. I enjoy consulting with customers who are growing, developing, and maturing exposure management and risk-based vulnerability management programs.</p>
